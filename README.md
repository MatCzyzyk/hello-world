Just another reporitory

Hi! 
My name is Mateusz! I'm 25 years old.
I'm new in github repository. I've used it on my studies before, but now I would like to proffesionally learn programming.
As a first language I will try to learn Java. 
I have graduaded Technical University in Gda≈Ñsk in 2018, and now I'm Master Engineer of Informatics, specialization: Computer Networks.

My "Hobby" is to teach dancing, specially ballroom and latin dances. Since I was 7 years old, I've stated dancing until 22. I've passed "dance instructor exam" when i was 19, and imidiately i've started teaching, even when I was a student. I've started teaching kids in my homecity, also in 2015 I've opened with my girlfriend a dancing courses for other students at my University, and since then We've already teached around 1000 students!
I'm a World Champion of Formation Standard in 2010, A lot of titles around 2007-2015 in formation (group of a 8 couples) standard. Also individualy I've achived Final of Polish Championships in Ballroom dancing in 2011 in Youth category, semi-finalist in 2012 in Adult category. I finished dancing in 2015 because of my 1st degre exam for an Engineer title. 

After I've passed my graduation diploma exam for a Master title, I feel motivated to start learing programming proffesionaly, because I was programing at my University, but it wasn't a big thing.

Have a nice day!
